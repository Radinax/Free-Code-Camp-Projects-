Hello, this is a challenge from the Free Code Camp course where I was tasked with creating a Tic Tac Toe game where you only had to face an AI, the game reset as soon as its over and been able to play as X or O. I add much more challenge to myself creating an unbeatable AI using MinMax algorithm recursive function, it was very hard to understand the whole concept behind and it wasn't until I read the book "You Don't Know JS" where I begun to understand so many important concepts that let me finish this challenge with vanilla Javascript. I'm very proud of my work in this challenge.
